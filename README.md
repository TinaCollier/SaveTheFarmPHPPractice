# SaveTheFarmPHPPractice
Word-based game to practice writing conditional statements in PHP.

## What Is This?
For this Codecademy challenge, I was tasked with writing a word-based game using conditional statements. This was a great way to practice nested conditionals and using ternary operators.

## How To Play
The player has 25 turns to complete the game. There is a set of instructions at the start of the game that list the available commands. The player inputs those commands (exactly as presented) and tries to beat the game in 25 turns or less. 

## What I Enjoyed
I'm very familiar with conditional statements as I've used them often in programming, but it was fun to practice them nonetheless. I enjoyed the plot of this game and it was very simple to create.
